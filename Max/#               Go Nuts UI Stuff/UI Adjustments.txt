Make all text the same colour as their avatar - e.g. green in 
example, and give them all the black outline (aside from 
position 1st etc. as this is similar to an 'objective' marker,
so the same colour as flag/tree). 

The outline will make them easier to see against the backdrop
and the sky in particular, but also with the colouration being
the same it means we have consistency of UI assets.

Make the player's avatar on the 'map' larger than everyone
elses, however put them on the furthest back layer. 
It will make it easier for them to see where everyone else is
in comparison to them, and it means they won't get lost behind
anyone else, nor block their own vision of where other players
are if they are behind them.

I have also moved the squirrel picture in the top left and the
player's position text in a bit. Keeping them closer together 
should make it clearer that they're meant to be read together
and it lines them up a bit better with all the other 'edge' UI.

I have moved the lap timers in towards the centre of the screen
as well, for much the same reason.

I tried playing the game for a few hours and honestly this is
the best I could come up with. The current UI assets work well,
I can see why Elliot and Zack struggled to work it. I've only
tried to make minor adjustments that don't cause any clarity
issues, or rather fix them where possible.
